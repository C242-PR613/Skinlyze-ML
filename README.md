# Skinlyze - Machine Learning Team (C242-PR613)
## Project Overview
This project aims to classify skin diseases to facilitate early detection and diagnosis, enabling timely treatment or medical examination. By leveraging Transfer Learning with MobileNet and TensorFlow, our model can identify and classify seven types of skin diseases: Actinic Keratoses and Intraepithelial Carcinoma/Bowen's Disease (AKIEC), Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), Benign Keratosis-like Lesions (BKL), Dermatofibroma (DF), Melanoma (MEL), Melanocytic Nevi (NV), and Vascular Lesions (VASC).

The system provides actionable insights, highlighting whether a detected condition requires immediate attention or further treatment. This approach aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy and support healthcare professionals in combating skin diseases, including malignant tumors and skin cancer, at earlier stages.
